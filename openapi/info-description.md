# Overview

This reference is designed to assist you in effectively utilizing the PayU REST API to enhance your online payment capabilities. Whether you're running an e-commerce store or developing applications that require secure and seamless payment processing, our API offers a range of features to meet your needs.

Our API offers a comprehensive set of endpoints to empower you with full control over your payment processes. With these endpoints, you can seamlessly create, capture, cancel, and retrieve orders, conduct payouts, and access essential reports.

For more details on the integration, please refer to the official <b><a href="/docs/">PayU documentation</a></b>. It provides comprehensive explanations, code samples, and best practices for seamless integration of the PayU API into your applications.

## Testing

### Production Environment

For a basic integration, including only a redirection to PayU hosted payment page, it is perfectly enough to use the public test point of sale. However, if you would like to test a full set of endpoints, including e.g. refunds, consider registering for a sandbox account.

**Public Test POS (point of sale)**

| Key name                       |                            Value |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------: |
| POS ID (pos_id)                |                           145227 |
| OAuth protocol - client_id     |                           145227 |
| Second key (MD5)               | 13a980d4f851f3d9a1cfc792fb1f5e50 |
| OAuth protocol - client_secret | 12f071174cb7eb79d4aac5bc2f07563f |

### Sandbox Environment

Sandbox is an almost identical copy of PayU production system. It can be used for integration and testing purposes.

**Public Test POS (Point of Sale)**

Although it is best to <b><a href="https://registration-merch-prod.snd.payu.com/boarding/#/registerSandbox/" target="_blank">create your own account</a></b> to later be able to configure it as needed, you may also use a public sandbox test POS without registering:

| Key name                       |                            Value |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------: |
| POS ID (pos_id)                |                           300746 |
| OAuth protocol - client_id     |                           300746 |
| Second key (MD5)               | b6ca15b0d1020e8094d9b5f8d163db54 |
| OAuth protocol - client_secret | 2ee86a66e5d97e3fadc400c9f19b065d |

The availability of the sandbox environment can be checked on the <b><a href="https://status.snd.payu.com/" target="_blank">Status page</a></b>.

**Testing Card Payments**

In order to test card payments on sandbox, please use credentials displayed on the <b><a href="/docs/testing/sandbox/" target="_blank">Sandbox</a></b> documentation page.

## Status Codes

## Transmission Encryption

> Since 30 June 2018 PayU supports only TLS 1.2 protocol.

Lack of support for older protocols is for security reasons. The TLS 1.2 protocol is the best transmission encryption method compliant with the highest security standard PCI DSS 3.2.

**The change applies to all transmission via HTTPS, therefore it includes all REST API and Classic API endpoints.**

Majority of e-commerce solutions and hosting providers make sure that their software is up-to-date. Therefore, if your site is using such a provider, most probably you have nothing to worry about. You can contact your service providers and ask whether they have updated their software.

If your site is a custom-built solution, make sure that it uses the latest version of the protocol. The following information could be useful:

### JAVA

Java 1.5 and below does not support TLS 1.2 In Java 1.6, TLS 1.2 is not supported in Oracle public updates. It is supported in the business edition starting Oracle java version 6u115 b32.

In Java 1.7, TLS1.2 is supported. But it needs to be explicitly enabled by selecting the enabled protocols while creating the SSLSocket & SSLEngine instances.

Please refer to: <b><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/jdk-8-will-use-tls-12-as-default" target="_blank">Oracle blog</a></b> for more details.

### cURL

Curl supports TLS1.2 starting 7.34.0. Please use the following command to test the connection.

> You may use any PayU endpoint. If you need help with Classic API integration contact our <b><a href="https://poland.payu.com/support/" target="_blank">support</a></b>.


If it works, you'll see **Unauthorized** message.

### cURL+PHP

```
    php -r '$ch = curl_init(); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "https://secure.payu.com/api/v2_1/orders"); 
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_SSLVERSION, 6); 
    var_dump(curl_exec($ch)); 
    var_dump(curl_error($ch));' 
```

If it works, you'll see "Unauthorized" message. TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported since OpenSSL 1.0.1. Forcing TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are only supported since curl 7.34.0.
