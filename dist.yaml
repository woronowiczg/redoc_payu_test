  description: "# Overview\r\n\r\nWith PayU, you will quickly activate payments on your website or mobile device.\r\n\r\nWe provide a full set of endpoints which allow you to create, capture, cancel and retrieve orders, perform payouts or download reports.\r\n\r\nThe following reference is intended for merchants and developers to facilitate the use of the PayU API. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Production environment \r\n\r\nFor a basic integration, including only a redirection to PayU hosted payment page, it is perfectly enough to use the public test point of sale. However, if you would like to test a full set of endpoints, including e.g. refunds, consider registering for a sandbox account.\r\n\r\n__Public test POS (point of sale)__\r\n\r\n| Key name                       | Value                            |\r\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------:|\r\n| POS ID (pos_id)                | 145227                           |\r\n| OAuth protocol - client_id     | 145227                           |\r\n| Second key (MD5)               | 13a980d4f851f3d9a1cfc792fb1f5e50 |\r\n| OAuth protocol - client_secret | 12f071174cb7eb79d4aac5bc2f07563f |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sandbox environment\r\n\r\nSandbox is an almost identical copy of PayU production system. It can be used for integration and testing purposes.\r\n\r\n__Public test POS (point of sale)__\r\n\r\nAlthough it is best to __<a href=\"https://registration-merch-prod.snd.payu.com/boarding/#/registerSandbox/\" target=\"_blank\">create your own account</a>__ to later be able to configure it as needed, you may also use a public sandbox test POS without registering:\r\n\r\n| Key name                       | Value                            |\r\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------:|\r\n| POS ID (pos_id)                | 300746                           |\r\n| OAuth protocol - client_id     | 300746                           |\r\n| Second key (MD5)               | b6ca15b0d1020e8094d9b5f8d163db54 |\r\n| OAuth protocol - client_secret | 2ee86a66e5d97e3fadc400c9f19b065d |\r\n\r\nThe availability of the sandbox environment can be checked on the __<a href=\"https://status.snd.payu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Status page</a>__.\r\n\r\n__Testing card payments__\r\n\r\nIn order to test card payments on sandbox, please use credentials displayed on the __<a href=\"https://developers.payu.com/en/overview.html#sandbox\" target=\"_blank\">Overview</a>__ documentation page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        Each payment should be authorized in one of two available modes: 

        - <code>client_credentials</code> for standard integration,

        for logged-in shop/application users with fixed
        <code>extCustomerId</code>.
